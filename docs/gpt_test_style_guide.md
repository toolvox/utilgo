# Summary of Testing Style in JSON and YAML Serialization Packages

The testing approach for JSON and YAML serialization/deserialization in Go is characterized by a detailed, structured, and comprehensive methodology, incorporating the use of the `testing`, `assert`, and `must. packages. Below are key highlights of this style with examples.

## Modular Setup

- **Test Data Definition**:
  - Structs like `demoObject` and `demoSubObject` are predefined to represent valid and invalid data.
  - Example:
    ```go
    var demoObj = demoObject{Name: "Demo", Value: -667, SubObject: demoSubObject{Flag: true}}
    ```

- **Error Preparation**:
  - Expected errors (syntax and validation errors) are predefined for comparison in tests.
  - Example:
    ```go
    _, demoSyntaxError := json.Unmarshal[demoObject](demoBadJson)
    ```

## Structured Test Suites

- **Sub-tests Usage**:
  - Tests are grouped into sub-tests using `t.Run` for better organization.
  - Example:
    ```go
    t.Run("Unmarshal", func(t *testing.T) { ... })
    ```

- **Test Setup**:
  - Temporary files and filesystems are used for file-related tests, ensuring isolation.
  - Example:
    ```go
    demoFile, err := os.CreateTemp(tempDir, "demo")
    ```

## Assertion Strategy

- **`assert` and `must. Distinction**:
  - `assert` for non-critical checks, and `must. for critical checks that should stop the test on failure.
  - Example:
    ```go
    assert.NoError(err)
    must.Equal(demonObj, obj)
    ```

## Error Handling and Panics

- **Error and Panic Tests**:
  - Tests for functions that can panic use `defer` and `recover`.
  - Example:
    ```go
    defer func() {
        r := recover()
        require.NotNil(r)
    }()
    ```

## File and Filesystem Operations

- **FS and File Handling**:
  - Demonstrates abstraction over filesystems and handling of file operations.
  - Example:
    ```go
    yaml.MustUnmarshalFS[demoObject](filepath.Base(demonFile.Name()), tempFS)
    ```

## Validation Logic

- **Custom Validation**:
  - Incorporates custom validation within the unmarshalling process.
  - Example:
    ```go
    func (v demoValidator) Validate() error { ... }
    ```

## Key Takeaways

This testing style is thorough and well-organized, focusing on readability, comprehensive coverage, and maintainability. The clear separation of setup, execution, and assertion phases, along with detailed handling of both success and error scenarios, ensures a robust testing framework for serialization and deserialization functionalities.
